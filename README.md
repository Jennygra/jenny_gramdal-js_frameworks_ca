## Description

The project involves creating a React or Next.js app with login functionality using Wordpress or Strapi installation with a REST or GraphQL API for API calls. It needs various paths like "/", "/detail/:param", "/contact", "/login", and "/admin," and should display an array of items with at least two properties and a single item fetched by a parameter. Upon successful login, the login form should redirect the user to the admin route. There should be a heading called "Admin" on the admin page. The project will be assessed using provided login credentials.
